% Simple harmonic motion - Euler Cromer method
% by Kevin Berwick,
% based on 'Computational Physics' book by N Giordano and H Nakanishi,
% section 3.1
% Equation is d2y/dt2 = -y
function [time,y] = SHM_Euler_Cromer (initial_displacement);
npoints = 2500;
dt = 0.04;
%Discretize time into 250 intervals
% time step in seconds
v = zeros(npoints,1); % initializes v, a vector of dimension npoints X 1,to being all zeros
y = zeros(npoints,1); % initializes y, a vector of dimension npoints X 1,to being all zeros
time = zeros(npoints,1); % this initializes the vector time to being all zeros
y(1)=initial_displacement;
% need some initial displacement
% Euler Cromer solution
for step = 1:npoints-1 % loop over the timesteps
v(step+1) = v(step) - y(step)*dt;
y(step+1) = y(step)+v(step+1)*dt;
time(step+1) = time(step) + dt;
