%Simple harmonic motion - Second order Runge Kutta method

% Equation is d2y/dt2 = -y
function [time,y] = SHM_Runge_Kutta(initial_displacement);
% 2nd order Runge Kutta solution

%Discretize time into 250 intervals
% time step in seconds
v = zeros(npoints,1); % initializes v, a vector of dimension npoints X 1,to being all zeros
y = zeros(npoints,1); % initializes y, a vector of dimension npoints X 1,to being all zeros
time = zeros(npoints,1); % this initializes the vector time to being all zeros
y(1)=initial_displacement;
